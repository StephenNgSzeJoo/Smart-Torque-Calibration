# Smart-Torque-Calibration
The Smart Torque Calibration Module automates the torque calibration process, significantly reducing cycle time by approximately 50%. This repository contains the source code and documentation for the module used by the Calibration Department. The product comes in the form of a WinForms application linked to a local MySqlDatabase which is linked to an ASP.NET with a remote Microsoft SQL Server.

# Features
Automated Calibration Process: Streamlines the torque calibration process, saving time and improving efficiency.

Compatibility: Currently supports HIOS torque meters, with potential for extending support to CEDAR torque meters through an offline solution.

Offline Capabilities: Addresses connectivity issues by enabling offline calibration tasks, ensuring uninterrupted workflow even in dead-wifi spots.

Comprehensive Record Management: Stores calibration task details, generates Certificates of Calibration, and measurement reports.

Potential for External Marketing: Opportunity to market the Smart Torque Automation solution independently from the web application.

# Usage
Calibration Engineers: Perform calibration tasks with enhanced efficiency and reduced cycle time.

Managers and Supervisors: Manage calibration service requests, track calibration status, and ensure equipment compliance.

Equipment Owners: Monitor and maintain the calibration status of their equipment.
